## Project Overview

Laravel 11 (PHP) web app migrating the Matchpointe Electron payroll desktop app to
`hr.matchpointegroup.com`. Multi-user with role-based access (admin, account_manager,
employee). Hosted on Bluehost Business Hosting (PHP/MySQL/Apache, $0 extra).

See `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for full brief, stack decisions, and constraints.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 0 — Scaffold + Auth ✅ _(closed 2026-03-19)_

- Laravel 13 + PHP 8.3 scaffolded into `web/` (Composer resolved 13.x; plan said 11 — runtime is 13)
- 14 MySQL migrations: 11 from SQLite schema + `daily_call_reports`, `placements`, `users` (extended)
- Laravel Breeze (Blade), Livewire, barryvdh/laravel-dompdf, Alpine.js via CDN
- `RequireRole` middleware (variadic roles, `abort(403)`); Gate `admin` + `account_manager`
- `AdminUserController` + `/admin/users` CRUD (list, create, edit, toggle active)
- Seeded admin: `admin@matchpointegroup.com` / `changeme123` / role=admin
- Shell layout: Tailwind CDN, sidebar placeholders, `@can('admin')` nav, flash messages
- HTTP smoke passed: `/login` 200, admin→`/admin/users` 200, employee→403
- Known carry-forward: PHPUnit needs SQLite fix for test env; `daily_call_reports` + `placements` are stubs

**Phase 1** — Backend Port — PENDING

## Conventions for This Project

- All Controllers in `app/Http/Controllers/` — one controller per IPC module
- Blade views in `resources/views/` — mirroring page names from original app
- Services in `app/Services/` — OvertimeCalculator, PdfService, etc.
- Every controller method must call `$this->authorize()` or check role explicitly
- Money fields stored as `DECIMAL(12,4)` in MySQL — never FLOAT
- OT calculation always goes through `OvertimeCalculator` — never inline
- File uploads stored in `storage/app/uploads/` — served via storage symlink
- Audit log entries must include `user_id` = `Auth::id()`
