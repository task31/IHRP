## Project Overview

Laravel 11 (PHP) web app migrating the Matchpointe Electron payroll desktop app to
`hr.matchpointegroup.com`. Multi-user with role-based access (admin, account_manager,
employee). Hosted on Bluehost Business Hosting (PHP/MySQL/Apache, $0 extra).

See `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for full brief, stack decisions, and constraints.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 0 — Scaffold + Auth ✅ _(closed 2026-03-19)_

- Laravel 13 + PHP 8.3 scaffolded into `web/` (Composer resolved 13.x; plan said 11 — runtime is 13)
- 14 MySQL migrations: 11 from SQLite schema + `daily_call_reports`, `placements`, `users` (extended)
- Laravel Breeze (Blade), Livewire, barryvdh/laravel-dompdf, Alpine.js via CDN
- `RequireRole` middleware (variadic roles, `abort(403)`); Gate `admin` + `account_manager`
- `AdminUserController` + `/admin/users` CRUD (list, create, edit, toggle active)
- Seeded admin: `admin@matchpointegroup.com` / `changeme123` / role=admin
- Shell layout: Tailwind CDN, sidebar placeholders, `@can('admin')` nav, flash messages
- HTTP smoke passed: `/login` 200, admin→`/admin/users` 200, employee→403
- Known carry-forward: PHPUnit needs SQLite fix for test env; `daily_call_reports` + `placements` are stubs

---

### Phase 1 — Backend Port ✅ _(closed 2026-03-19)_

- 13 controllers ported from Electron IPC (Client, AuditLog, Dashboard, Budget, Ledger, InvoiceSequence, Consultant, Settings, Timesheet, Invoice, Report, Backup + existing Admin)
- `OvertimeCalculator.php` — 52-jurisdiction PHP port of `overtime.js`; 45 PHPUnit tests, 120 assertions, 0 failures
- `AppService` (auditLog / getSetting / setSetting / **applySmtpSettings** — runtime SMTP override from settings table)
- `TimesheetParseService` (PhpSpreadsheet), `PdfService` (DomPDF), `InvoiceFormatter`, `LedgerQueryService`
- `InvoiceMailable` + `mail/invoice-note.blade.php` + `pdf/invoice.blade.php` + `pdf/report-monthly.blade.php` + `pdf/report-yearend.blade.php`
- phpunit.xml → SQLite in-memory (feature tests run without live MySQL)
- SMTP credentials loaded from settings table at runtime via `AppService::applySmtpSettings()` + `Mail::forgetMailers()`
- Known carry-forwards: `BudgetController::alerts()` audit log; `ReportController::saveCsv()` server-side query; `timesheets.source_file_path` populate-or-drop; `storage/app/templates/timesheet_template.xlsx` placeholder needed

## Active Phase

**Phase 5** — Deploy _(see PHASES.md)_

---

### Phase 6 — Payroll Integration ✅ _(closed 2026-03-22)_

- **5 migrations:** `payroll_uploads`, `payroll_records` (UNIQUE `user_id+check_date`), `payroll_consultant_entries`, `payroll_consultant_mappings`, `payroll_goals` — all money `DECIMAL(12,4)`
- **5 models:** `PayrollUpload`, `PayrollRecord`, `PayrollConsultantEntry`, `PayrollConsultantMapping`, `PayrollGoal` — all with `scopeForOwner` and `belongsTo`
- **Services:** `PayrollParseResult` DTO; `PayrollParseService` (sheet[0] summary parse: Check Date col, trailing-space SS header, `Subttal` typo, stop-name row exclusion, 401k optional); `PayrollDataService` (bcmath throughout, projection with `too_early`/`no_data` suppression, per-AM breakdown via live DB query)
- **HTTP:** `PayrollController` — 8 methods, 8 auth guards, `getOwnerId()` helper (admin requires AM `user_id`, strict 422), upload uses `DB::transaction` + `AppService::auditLog`
- **8 routes** in `web.php`; Payroll nav link inside `@can('account_manager')`
- **UI:** `payroll/index.blade.php` (Chart.js 4.4.3, KPIs, bar/donut/YoY/trend/table, consultant drawer, admin upload modal, AM comparison, goal tracker); `payroll/mappings.blade.php`
- **Extras added during smoke:** `@livewireScripts→@livewireScriptConfig` fix (dual Alpine); double-reload guard via `$watch`+`isLoading`; goal tracker UI; `401k` optional; upload auto-creates Consultants; `gross_margin_per_hour DECIMAL(12,4)` on consultants; inline cell editing on Consultants page (`PATCH /consultants/{id}/field`); 3 additional migrations for nullable rate fields + GMPH + nullable `client_id`
- **Tests:** `PayrollParseServiceTest` (8), `PayrollDataServiceTest` (8), `PayrollControllerTest` (22) — **107 total, 259 assertions, 0 failures**
- **Smoke:** 3 AM files uploaded (Harsono 2018–2026, Sibug 2018–2026, Dimarumba 2019–2024); admin aggregate verified across all years; empty-state AM shows $0 correctly; 19/19 Playwright checks pass
- **Known carry-forward:** Dimarumba has orphaned `payroll_records` rows with dates in years 19/209/2002/2010 (bad Excel serial date parse from initial upload) — delete via `WHERE YEAR(check_date) < 2015 AND user_id=7` before production deploy

---

### Phase 4 — Data Migration + QA ✅ _(closed 2026-03-20)_

- SQLite → MySQL migration script (`migrate:run`) + validation command (`migrate:validate`) — 12 tables, row-count + money checksum
- File migration (`migrate:files`) — W-9s and invoice PDFs moved to `storage/app/uploads/`
- Full manual regression smoke — all pages PASS for admin + account_manager roles
- **Employee role removed** — DB enum altered, controllers/policies/views updated, existing users migrated to account_manager
- **Placements refactor** — `consultant_name` free-text field (was FK dropdown); auto-creates consultant on save via case-insensitive `firstOrCreate`; always-editable status dropdown; AM column added; backdrop no longer closes modal on outside click
- **AM access restricted** — nav limited to Calls + Placements; placements scoped to own records (`placed_by`); dashboard blocked (403); login redirects to `/placements`
- **Calls Report** — restricted to admin only
- **Dashboard** — Budget Utilization admin-only; employee section removed entirely
- **Consultant end-date colors** — past dates gray, 0–7d red, 8–14d orange, 15–30d yellow (was incorrectly red for past)
- **Layout fix** — `$header` slot moved to `<main>` (was rendering buttons inside sidebar)
- OT tests: 44 passed, 120 assertions, 0 failures — no regression

---

### Phase 3 — New Features ✅ _(closed 2026-03-19)_

- `daily_call_reports` + `placements` full schema migrations (DECIMAL(12,4) rates, UNIQUE constraint on call reports)
- `DailyCallReport` + `Placement` models; `DailyCallReportController` (index, store, aggregate) + `PlacementController` (index, store, update, destroy)
- `/calls` — all roles submit; own history; AM/admin see all employees
- `/calls/report` — AM + admin aggregate summary with per-employee totals; employee → 403
- `/placements` — Livewire `PlacementManager` (filters, inline status change, CRUD modal); employee read-only scoped view
- Employee dashboard — My Placement card + 7-day call activity + quick-submit form; admin/AM unchanged (4 Alpine stat cards)
- Sidebar: Calls (all roles) + Placements (AM/admin only) nav links added
- Bug fixed: Blade directive inside HTML attribute `colspan` caused unclosed PHP `if` → 500 on `/placements`; fixed with PHP expression
- Smoke: 12/12 PASS across all 3 roles
- Carry-forwards to Phase 4: `users.consultant_id` admin UI; auditLog actor gap (queue context); clean up `smoke_*.py` files

---

### Phase 2 — Frontend Port ✅ _(closed 2026-03-19)_

- Step 0: sidebar nav wired to named routes (`@can` gates, `routeIs()` active state), Alpine toast system, global `apiFetch()` with CSRF header merge
- Phase 2a (Steps 1–4): Dashboard (4 stat cards + end-date alerts + budget bars via Alpine fetch), Clients (CRUD modal, client-side sort), Consultants (onboarding modal, W-9 upload), Invoices (PDF preview iframe via blob URL), Ledger (detail + summary toggle)
- Phase 2b (Steps 5–7): Timesheets Livewire wizard (`TimesheetWizard.php` — upload→parse→preview-OT→import), Reports (year-end PDF, monthly CSV server-driven), Settings (6-tab layout, SMTP test, logo upload, backup download)
- All 3 Phase 1 carry-forwards fixed: budget alerts audit log, `downloadMonthlyCsv()` server-driven, `source_file_path` populated on import
- Template file placed: `storage/app/templates/timesheet_template.xlsx`
- `reports/save-csv` route removed; `reports/save-pdf` and `reports/monthly-csv` are the two report write paths
- OT tests: 44 tests, 120 assertions, 0 failures (no regression)
- Browser smoke (Step 8 checklist) deferred — carry-forward gate for Phase 3 start

## Conventions for This Project

- All Controllers in `app/Http/Controllers/` — one controller per IPC module
- Blade views in `resources/views/` — mirroring page names from original app
- Services in `app/Services/` — OvertimeCalculator, PdfService, etc.
- Every controller method must call `$this->authorize()` or check role explicitly
- Money fields stored as `DECIMAL(12,4)` in MySQL — never FLOAT
- OT calculation always goes through `OvertimeCalculator` — never inline
- File uploads stored in `storage/app/uploads/` — served via storage symlink
- Audit log entries must include `user_id` = `Auth::id()`
